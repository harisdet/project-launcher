Screenshot review: Dashboard is rendering correctly with language switcher showing "English" in sidebar.
All navigation items visible: Dashboard, Customers, Vehicles, Job Cards, Reminders.
The language switcher appears at the bottom of the sidebar nav with a Globe icon.
No TypeScript errors. Server running correctly.
Need to run tests and save checkpoint.
